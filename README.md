# Data-Science
I have understood the inner workings of the data analytics pipeline - joining, manipulating, filtering, extracting data and analysing data.
Starting with importing messy data, cleaning data, merging and concatenating data, grouping and aggregating data, exploratory data analysis through to preparing and processing data for statistics, machine learning and data presentation.
For each of the mini projects that I did, I have added their corresponding dataset links and jupyter notebooks.
Happy Learning!
